# Predicting NBA shots

In this notebook, three ML models are used to predict whether a basketball shot is successful (hits the basket and scores a point) or not. Specifically, we'll look at all the basketball shots made during the 2014-2015 NBA season scraped from the NBA's API and provided on kaggle [(https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/nba-shot-logs/home)](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/nba-shot-logs/home).


The ML models used are
 * penalised logistic regression
 * Single Classification Tree
 * Random Forests

The output of the notebook can be found in the [main.md](main.md) file. The full code is located in the [main.Rmd](main.Rmd) file.
